            problem:
                "Client needed way to convert instagram views into clients. He wanted to stand out more as a professional by having a website to help drive traffic to his business.",
            solution:
                "I created a portfolio website for him to allow potential clients to get a better feel for who he is a photographer. Photos on Instagram does not allow a potential client get a complete feel for who you are as a business like a website does. By creating this portfolio clients can now easily view his work and send him emails through a contact form on the site.",
            obstacles:
                "The design process took me longer than expected since I have never designed a website before. All my experience was in strictly coding sites prior. Trying to implement a carousel for the first time as well was a little bit of a task at first.",
            learned:
                "The most important and by far the most valuable thing I learned was the ability to listen to the client and what they want. I can only offer opinions but at the end of the day the client is the one paying for the job you just have to do it right. In addition, I learned how to randomize photos on the Home Screen of the website so every time a client views the page the images in certain sections are different. I learned how to implement a carousel slider and attach testimonals to an image on hover effect.",
